# ML-classification-healthcare-data-competition
This is a health care data competition using Machine learning model to predict impatient rate.
**The available data was disguised and altered for pedagogical purposes.**

The competition is mainly about data mining from patients' medical history data to make prediction the probability or even 
binary behavior(inpatient or not).

Data cleansing process:
* Regular expression(Regex) of text cleansing
* variables gathering, spread , and split to tidy the dataset.
* new variables of intersection
* one-hot encoding transformation

Model contains:
* Logistic regression
* neural network
* Random Forest

Accuracy
* 85% accuracy
